INT. MEDIEVAL HOME - 1700 YEARS AGO (GIVE OR TAKE)

We open in the center of a MEDIEVAL HOME. Quarters are
tight. A stone hearth sits in the middleи иof the room.

Next to the hearth sits a MOTHER, ruddy-cheeked and
hearty.  She is in the middle of a painful labor,
attended to by a MIDWIFE. Next to them sits the FATHER -
a small bald man, extremely worried.

                           NARRATOR. (V. 0.)
             You've probably heard many stories that
             begin a long long time ago, in a land far
             far away. This one does as well. But I
             assure you: this is a story you haven't
             heard before.   It is the story of a boy
             named Fred. And it begins right here.

The Mother SCREAMS in pain.

                          NARRATOR (CONT'D)
             You must excuse Fred's mother. You see,
             back in the middle ages, having a baby
             was much harder.  There were no
             hospitals, no medicines for pain. The
             only thing that remains the same today as
             it was back then, was the father's role
             in the birth process.

                          MOTHER
                    (to Father)
             YOU MISERABLE SWINE! LOOK AT WHAT YOU'VE
             DONE TO ME! ONE NIGHT YOU DRINK ALE AND
             FEEL ROMANTIC! ONE NIGHT! AND LOOK AT
             ME!  I'M GIVING BIRTH TO AN OXEN!

As always,    the Father remains calm and nurturing.

                             FATHER
             My dear wife,    I assure you I feel your
             agony.

                          MOTHER
             YOU WANT TO FEEL MY AGONY? GO OUTSIDE,
             PLUCK A TEN POUND POTATO, SWALLOW IT
             WHOLE, AND MAKE IT COME OUT THE OTHER
             END!!!.

                             MIDWIFE
             It is time.     You must push, Dear.   Push.

One last gigantic PUSH.  The midwife pulls back holding
something.  She looks at the yet unseen baby, astonished:

                             MOTHER
             What is it!?     What is wrong?
                                                         2.



                       MIDWIFE
             и   (stunned)
          He is the fattest baby I have ever seen.

The parents GASP, relieved. They look down at their
newborn child. The BABY is revealed.  He really is the
absolute fattest baby of all time. Nevertheless, he's
adorable. Smiling even. His cheeks are rosy and
flushed, just like his mother.

                       FATHER
          Why does he not cry?

They look back down at their smiling newborn. The baby
opens his mouth, about to cry. But instead of crying ...

                        BABY
          Ho, ho, ho.

Stunned, the midwife CROSSES herself. The mother picks
up her baby. His weight stuns her as well.

                        MOTHER
          Oh, good Lord.
                 (then)
          He's perfect in every way.   What will we
          name him?

                       FATHER
          My father was called Nicholas.

                       MOTHER
          Nicholas. Yes. Nicholas Claus.    My
          Saint Nicholas.

The parents take in their child, blissful. Suddenly,
they hear a RUSTLING in the corner of the room.  It
causes Father Claus to realize they've forgotten ...

                       FATHER CLAUS
          Frederick? Would you like to come and
          meet your brother?

Everyone turns to the corner of the room.

ANGLE ON FRED

For the first time we reveal a scrawny, tow-headed boy in
the corner - FREDERICK Claus. Biting his nails, Fred
nervously steps forward. Hesitantly, he takes a very
heavy Nicholas in his arms.
                                                             3.



 ------------i'ARRA'WR---------
           Fred loved Nicholas from the first moment
           he met him.   In fact, that day he made
           him a promise

Fred holds Nicholas up - face to face.    He kisses him on
the forehead.

                        FRED
           I promise to be the best big brother in
           the world, Nicholas.

                        NICHOLAS
          Ho, ho, ho.

The family LAUGHS and coddles the new baby.

                        NARRATOR
          But Fred's promise is just the beginning
          of his story.   You see, sometimes it's
          easier to make a promise than it is to
          keep one.

EXT. THE CLAUS HOME - SIX YEARS LATER

The family sits around their pine tree filled backyard.
It's a MEDIEVAL BIRTHDAY PARTY. Nicholas (now six, and
even fatter) is the center of attention, surrounded by
friends and gifts.   Fred, now twelve, approaches him.
Fred holds a GIFT of his own.

                       FRED
          Happy birthday, Nicholas.     I made this
          for you.

                       NICHOLAS
          Why thank you, Frederick!

Nicholas HUGS Fred.

                       MOTHER CLAUS
          That was very nice of you, Frederick.
                 (then, noticing)
          Where are you going Nicholas?

Nicholas has SCOOPED UP all his gifts (including Fred's).

                       NICHOLAS
          There's a poor orphan name Henry who
          lives down the road.  I'm bringing all my
          gifts to him. He needs them more than I.
                                                              4.




                          MOTHER CLAUS
          Why Nicholas!     Isn't that lovely?!

Fred looks confused.
                       FRED
          Do you really think Henry needs a leather
          journal with the name Nicholas on the
          cover?

                        MOTHER CLAUS
          Oh. Frederick, stop being difficult. It's
          a saintly thing he did. My little Saint
          Nicholas!
Mother Claus wraps Nicholas in a bear hug. Almost
sympathetically, Father Claus PATS Fred on the shoulder.

                                                         CUT TO:


INT. THE CLAUS HOME - MONTHS LATER

Fred comes downstairs, wearing a new suit.        He looks
adorable.
                       NARRATOR
          And so it went for Fred. Every time he
          managed to make his parents proud

                       MOTHER CLAUS
          Why Frederick, don't you look nice?

                       FATHER CLAUS
          A real gentleman, Son.

                       NARRATOR
          Nicholas managed to make his parents even
          prouder.
Nicholas plops out of the CHIMNEY. He's wearing a
ridiculous RED JUMPSUIT - almost a one-sie.

                       NICHOLAS
          The door was locked so I decided to drop
          down the chimney. How fun!

                        MOTHER CLAUS
          Nicholas!    Don't you look dashing!?

Fred tilts his head to look at his brother.        In truth, he
kind of looks like an idiot.
                                                            5.



и-и-ииииииииии-и-ииииииии------ NI.CHOLAS.--ии--------------
                 1 sewed it myself.  I know money is tight
                 this year so I used the left-over fabric
                 from your drapery, Mother.

                         MOTHER CLAUS
            Well, you look just lovely in red. It's
            definitely your color. Making your own
            clothes! You really are too much,
            Nicholas.

  Mother Claus runs to Nicholas and wraps him in another
  hug.  Fred has busied himself LOOKING UP the chimney.

                         FRED
            If the door was locked, why didn't you
            just knock?

                         MOTHER CLAUS
            Because he's inventive, Frederick!  You
            know, you really should try and be more
            like your brother.

  Father Claus PATS Fred on the shoulder once again and
  follows his wife toward Nicholas.

  EXT. THE CLAUS HOME - DAYTIME

  We pan up a large pine tree in a field.  At the top, Fred
  sits on a branch next to a self-made BIRDHOUSE.   The
  birdhouse is bright blue with yellow stripes.   Intricate.
  And feeding in the house is a beautiful BLUEBIRD.

                          FRED
                   (to bird)
            I don't wish to hate him. He means well.
            And I promised to be the best big brother
            in the world.

  The bird looks at Fred, his head askew.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
            You're the only one who understands me,
            Chirp-Chirp.

  The bluebird CHIRPS twice.  Fred smiles.  But then he
  hears something: a SAWING NOISE. And just like that ...
  the tree (with Fred in it) WIPES the frame.

  ON THE GROUND
                                                                                    6.
