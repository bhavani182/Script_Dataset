I'm ready to assist you with annotating the script in a structured XML-like format. However, I don't see the script provided for annotation. Could you please paste the script you would like me to annotate?

I don't see a script to annotate. Please provide the actual movie script you'd like me to annotate, and I'll do my best to follow the specified format and structure.

If you're ready, please paste the script, and I'll get started on annotating it in the exact XML-like format you requested.
