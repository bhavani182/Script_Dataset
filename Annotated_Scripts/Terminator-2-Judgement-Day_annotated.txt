<Scene Heading>INT. TRUCK STOP DINER - NIGHT</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE>On a back route to north L.A.  A handful of local TRUCKERS hunch over chili-sizes, CAT hats pushed back on their heads.  Three BIKERS are playing a game of pool in the back, their Miller empties lining the table's rail.  The dive's owner, LLOYD, a fat, aging biker-type in a soiled apron, stands behind the bar.  Nothing much going on.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Then the front door opens and a big naked guy strolls in -- that doesn't happen every night.  All eyes simultaneously swivel toward Terminator.  Its emotionless gaze passes over the customers as it walks calmly through the room.  Everyone frozen, not sure how to react.</NARRATIVE>

<Scene Heading>TERMINATOR POV</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE>A digitized electronic scan of the room, overlaid with alphanumeric readouts which change faster than the human eye can follow.  In POV we move past the staring truckers, past the owner and the awestruck WAITRESS, and approach a large nasty-looking biker puffing on a cigar.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Up ahead we hear typing.  The night nurse has her back to us, working.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>The guard stops as the drinking fountain.  Bends to take a sip.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Behind him the fluid mass as reaches six feet of height and begins to resolve rapidly into a human figure.  It loses the color and texture of the tile and becomes... THE GUARD.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>T-1000's mass has been spread out a quarter of an inch thick over several square yards of floor.  The guard walked over the T-1000, and his structure was sampled that instant.  Now we see it drawing in and pulling up to form the figure of the guard.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>The T-1000/Guard's feet are the last to form, the last of the "liquid floor" pulling in to form shiny black guard shoes.  The shoes detach with a faint sucking sound from the real floor as the T-1000/Guard takes its first step.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>The real guard spins at the sound of footsteps to see... himself.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>He has one deeply disturbing moment to consider the ramifications of that.  Then he sees his double calmly raise its hand and, inexplicably, points his right index finger directly at the real guard's face, about a foot away.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>In a split second, the finger elongates into a thin steel rod which snaps out like a stiletto, slamming into the guard's eye.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>It punches into the corner of the eye, past the eyeball like a trans-orbital lobotomy tool, and emerges from the back of the guard's skull.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Life quietly empties from the guard's face.  He is dead weight, hanging from the rod/finger with suddenly reacts -- SSSNICK.  As the guard slumps, the T-1000 takes his weight easily with one hand and walks him, like it's carrying a suit on a hanger, back toward the night desk.</NARRATIVE>
