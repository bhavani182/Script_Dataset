<Scene Heading>EXT. TOP OF HILL ON OTHER SIDE OF POND LOOKING BACK AT HIS HOUSE - DAY</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE>ABEL stands, surrounded by massive trees in the thick forest, looking across the ridge back at his house. He is a little out of breath after climbing the hill but he looks strangely comfortable even though he is standing in the woods in a suit, tie, and dress shoes.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>He takes a nice cigar out of his pocket, lights it and has a real moment of joy. He looks up to the tops of the trees, then back at the new house.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>He exhales a long deep breath. Then we hear a large truck come rumbling in the driveway. He hears it.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>His face shows that he is aware of something coming.</NARRATIVE>

Here is the annotated script:

Note: I've annotated the script according to the given format, but there are some discrepancies in the original text that make it difficult to provide a perfect annotation. For example, the character JULIAN is mentioned but not present in any dialogue or narration. Similarly, the scene heading and location are missing. If you can provide more context or clarify these points, I'll be happy to revise the annotation.
