<Scene Heading>EXT. THE GREAT PLAINS SOUTH DAKOTA - DAWN</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE>A DRUM. Beating slow. And deep. Like a heart.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Something is rising from the Black Hills. A sphere of light, too red to be the sun. A sphere of contained fire, undulating in crimson and ochre, and rising slowly, majestically, to the pulse. To the DRUM. It is the sun. But it is a Paha Sapa sunrise. A Black Hills sunrise. And it is spectacular.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>The DRUM, pounds deeper, bigger, as the sun gets higher. Stronger. Igniting a vast landscape of gentle slopes and foothills; throwing shadows on the plains that look like, as the Indians say, an old man dancing. The grass is golden. And high. The wind moves through it, snakes through it. Slowly.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Voices; a TRADITIONAL INDIAN SONG (Lakota), summoning Wakan Tanka - The Great Mystery.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>And now, rising up over one of the small land waves, a head comes into view. Shoulders. A man, running in ghostly slow motion, his long black hair trailing in the wind. The INDIAN MAN wears only buckskin pants and a bone choker around his neck.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Legs and arms churning, the man runs with antelope grace,</NARRATIVE>
