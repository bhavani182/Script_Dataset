<Scene Heading>EXT - ALLEN STREET, TOMBSTONE - DAY</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE>Tombstone is new and colorful, part town, part mining camp, a wild mixture of brightly painted wooden storefronts and half-finished stone buildings rimmed by clusters of tents and shanties, all perched atop a hill with a magnificent view of the desert and the purple Dragoon mountains beyond.  We HEAR the vibrant din of hammers and saws, player pianos, hurdy-gurdys, clip-clopping horses' hooves, and pealing laughter as the Earps drive up Allen Street, the main drag, lined with saloon after saloon, sidewalks bustling with drovers, miners, Chinamen, and sullen gun-toting hard-cases.  They pull up in front of the Grand Hotel and step down.  <Character_Name>JOHNNY BEHAN</Character_Name>, handsome, well-dressed, wearing an ornate crescent-shaped gold sheriff's badge and a ready smile walks up and shakes hands:</NARRATIVE>
