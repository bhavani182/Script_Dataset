<NARRATIVE>Epps isn't wasting anymore time. When Wes turns to glower at Jaeger he lunges up for him. Wes side steps Epps and lands the but of his rifle into the side of Epps' head. It opens a wound, and sends Epps back down to the ground.</NARRATIVE>

<Scene Heading>EXT. DUNES - DAY</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE>Two men, <Character_Name>EPPS</Character_Name> and <Character_Name>JAEGER</Character_Name>, are running through the dunes until their bodies scream no more, then they keep going on inertia.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Reaching a dune, they tumble down the far side and collapse in a heap at the bottom. They take a moment to catch what breath they can, then:</NARRATIVE>

</Turn>
</DIALOGUE>

<NARRATIVE>They sit there trying to catch their breath. As they do, a sound comes from the distance. They freeze, ears cocked, trying to figure out what it is.</NARRATIVE>

<DIALOGUE>
<Turn>
<Character_Name>JAEGER</Character_Name>
<Utterance>(CONT) It's a helicopter!</Utterance>

<NARRATIVE>Epps can't make out for sure. Jaeger asks again with growing anxiety.</NARRATIVE>

<Scene Heading>JAEGER(CONT)</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE>Ours, or theirs?</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Epps takes a long, hard stare.</NARRATIVE>

<DIALOGUE>

<Utterance>Ours. It's one of ours. We've got to signal them; let them know we're down here.</Utterance>

<NARRATIVE>The instant Jaeger hears this his face twists up like he's thinking something, and he doesn't like what it is he's thinking.</NARRATIVE>

<Utterance>We're lost, you understand that? We've been out here for...</Utterance>
</Turn>
</DIALOGUE>

<Scene Heading>DESERT - DAY</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE>Epps and Jaeger are stranded with no navigational device, making it impossible for them to find their way back. They're discussing their situation.</NARRATIVE>

<DIALOGUE>
<Turn>
<Character_Name>JAEGER</Character_Name>
<Utterence>I got no navicom, and no means to find a way back. So right now I don't give a damn about the gold because if we don't get off this desert, and out of Iraq, all it's going to be good for is buying us tombstones.</Utterence>
</Turn>

<NARRATIVE>Epps is back around ready to signal the helicopter. He's about to raise the mirror when he hears the sound of an M-16 action being worked. Epps turns to face Jaeger.</NARRATIVE>

<DIALOGUE>
<Turn>
<Character_Name>JAEGER</Character_Name>
<Utterence>I can't do it, Epps. Not when we're so close. I can't let you ruin everything.</Utterence>
</Turn>

<NARRATIVE>Epps just stares at Jaeger, not frightened, but surprisingly calm.</NARRATIVE>

<DIALOGUE>
<Turn>
<Character_Name>EPPS</Character_Name>
<Utterence>First Wes, now you?</Utterence>
</Turn>

<NARRATIVE>Jaegeer responds in a nonchalant manner.</NARRATIVE>

<DIALOGUE>
<Turn>
<Character_Name>JAEGER</Character_Name>
<Utterence>I'm not like Wes. Wes was crazy.</Utterence>
</Turn>

<NARRATIVE>Epps' tone turns sarcastic as he responds to Jaeger's assertion.</NARRATIVE>

<DIALOGUE>
<Turn>
<Character_Name>EPPS</Character_Name>
<Parenthetical>(Sarcastic)</Parenthetical>
<Utterence>And you; you've got it all together.</Utterence>
</Turn>

<NARRATIVE>Jaegeer attempts to defend his actions, stating that he's not trying to kill Epps out of malice but rather prevent him from losing the gold.</NARRATIVE>

<DIALOGUE>
<Turn>
<Character_Name>JAEGER</Character_Name>
<Utterence>I don't want it this way. I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me. Not when we're so close.</Utterence>
</Turn>

<NARRATIVE>Epps counters Jaeger's reasoning by pointing out that they're not close to escaping the desert.</NARRATIVE>

<DIALOGUE>
<Turn>
<Character_Name>EPPS</Character_Name>
<Utterance>That helicopter passes, and the only thing we're close to is death.</Utterence>
</Turn>

<NARRATIVE>Jaegeer remains unphased by Epps' statement and politely invites him to sit down. Epps has no choice but to comply as the camera stays tight on the two men.</NARRATIVE>

<DIALOGUE>
<Turn>
<Character_Name>JAEGER</Character_Name>
<Utterence>Sit down, Epps.</Utterence>
</Turn>

<NARRATIVE>The scene becomes tense as the sound of a helicopter grows louder and closer. It eventually fades away, leaving Epps and Jaeger with their situation unresolved.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>The camera stays on the two men as they remain silent and motionless, awaiting an uncertain fate.</NARRATIVE>

<Scene Heading>JAeger lowers his rifle</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE>Jaeager is standing in the middle of a desert, very genuinely saying something to Epps.</NARRATIVE>

<DIALOGUE>
<Turn>
<Character_Name>JAEGER</Character_Name>
<Utterance>I'm sorry about that, Epps.</Utterance>
</Turn>
</DIALOGUE>

<NARRATIVE>Epps asks if he can stand up.</NARRATIVE>

<DIALOGUE>
<Turn>
<Character_Name>EPPS</Character_Name>
<Utterance>Is it all right if I stand up?</Utterance>
</Turn>
</DIALOGUE>

<NARRATIVE>Jaeager responds that Epps is free to stand up.</NARRATIVE>

<DIALOGUE>
<Turn>
<Character_Name>JAEGER</Character_Name>
<Utterance>Oh, yeah. Go ahead.</Utterance>
</Turn>
</DIALOGUE>

<NARRATIVE>Epps stands and looks around to try to figure things out.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>There's not much for him to figure out; they're still in the middle of a desert in a hostile country, just as they were before.</NARRATIVE>

<DIALOGUE>
<Turn>
<Character_Name>JAEGER</Character_Name>
<Utterance>I'm glad I didn't have to kill you. I'm glad it didn't come to that.</Utterance>

<NARRATIVE>Jaeager continues talking.</NARRATIVE>

<DIALOGUE>
<Turn>
<Character_Name>JAEGER</Character_Name>
<Utterance>I never killed anybody before. I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.</Utterance>
</Turn>
</DIALOGUE>

<DIALOGUE>
<Turn>
<Character_Name>EPPS</Character_Name>
<Utterance>Sure.</Utterance>
</Turn>
</DIALOGUE>

<NARRATIVE>Jaeager says he's telling the truth about never killing before.</NARRATIVE>

<DIALOGUE>
<Turn>
<Character_Name>JAEGER</Character_Name>
<Utterance>Really, I'm not. Remember how I was talking – I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis? That's all it was was talk. I was scared out of my mind to go to war.</Utterance>
</Turn>

<Turn>
<Character_Name>JAEGER</Character_Name>
<Utterance>I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.</Utterance>

<DIALOGUE>
<Turn>
<Character_Name>JAEGER</Character_Name>
<Utterance>What? Yeah.</Utterance>
</Turn>
</DIALOGUE>

<NARRATIVE>Epps looks over the maps and then at the terrain, concluding that without landmarks or navigating tools the maps might as well be finger paintings.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE> Outside the traffic away from Kuwait has gotten so thick, everything is at a stand still. There are Iraqi military vehicles pulling out, as well as a good many civilian cars and trucks. It clogs up both lanes, and envelopes the car. Some people try to make their way on foot as it is now much faster.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Time starts again, and with a deadly vengeance. The fighter pilots begin to strafe the highway: Vehicles and people, civilian and military alike. There is no distinction, only carnage.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>This is the infamous Al Jahra highway from Basrah to Kuwait City that was strafed with deadly accuracy over and over on the last day of the war by American forces. It became known as the Highway of Death.</NARRATIVE>

<Utterance>The members of this tribunal have reached a verdict.  Based on the evidence presented we find the defendant guilty as charged of desertion, insurrection, insubordination, and conduct unbecoming.</Utterance>
<Utterance>Further the tribunal will recommend that the defendant be sentenced to life imprisonment, and that from this day forward he shall no longer walk as a free man.  You should consider yourself quite fortunate, son.</Utterance>
<Utterance>There was a time when lesser crimes would have found you before a firing squad.  I don't know that a person like you has much to say for himself, but it is your right to say something.</Utterance>

<Utterance>You know what it's like to have gold raining out of your hands?  That'll give me enough to think about the rest of my days in the brig.</Utterance>
<Utterance>I'm just sorry about Wes.  He was all right.</Utterance>
<Utterance>It was the gold that made him what he became.</Utterance>

<Turn>
<Character_Name>JAEGER</Character_Name>
<Utterance>I guess they both could have been burned to slag.  I guess.  But there were a lot of bodies out on that road.  A smart man could have found some identification to use.</Utterance>
