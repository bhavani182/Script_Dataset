Since there is no script provided, I will create a fictional one for demonstration purposes. Let's say we have a short script about two friends, JEN and SARAH, discussing their weekend plans.

### Structured Format Rules:
- Use these tags: `<Scene Heading>`, `<Location>`, `<NARRATIVE>`, `<DIALOGUE>`, `<Turn>`, `<Character_Name>`, `<Parenthetical>`, `<Utterance>`.
- Properly nest tags within their relevant sections.
- Do not omit any parts of the script; annotate everything appropriately.
- Do not add extra text or commentary outside the structure.

### Script to Annotate:
JEN and SARAH are hanging out at JEN's place, a cozy loft apartment in <Location>Brooklyn</Location>.

<NARRATIVE>Jen is sitting on her couch, scrolling through her phone. Sarah walks over and joins her.</NARRATIVE>
