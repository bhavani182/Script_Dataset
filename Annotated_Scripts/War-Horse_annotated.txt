<NARRATIVE> The convoy struggles up the hill. Joey feels the dead weight of the gun. These are several tons of cast iron - almost dwarfing the horses. <Character_Name>Friedrich</Character_Name> notices. Together, this grim circus struggles along the pot-holed country road in the rain.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE> Joey leads the team up the incline. Each step is an immense effort. The going, over rough scree, is very tough indeed. It is very difficult for Joey to get a foothold on the loose ground, but his experience in <Location>Dartmoor</Location> comes into play and although he almost loses his balance several times he stays upright and hauls the cannon - Fitzcarraldo-like - over the hill.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE> We follow his progress step by step. <Character_Name>Friedrich</Character_Name> watches anxiously. Soldiers strain at the sides of the gun. One throws boards under the wheels to aid in traction. As they reach the top of the hill it almost seems the effort is too much, the cannon always in danger of rolling back.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE> Joey finally staggers over the top - it feels as though the tethers are going to snap with the strain - but at last the cannon reaches the peak, the crest of the hill.</NARRATIVE>
