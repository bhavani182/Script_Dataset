<NARRATIVE>A "Have A Nice Day" HAPPY FACE PIN is close on a "Have A Nice Day" HAPPY FACE PIN, STEAM rises past the pin. We hear a KETTLE BOILING.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>We PULL BACK and find that the pin adorns the lapel of a ROBE worn by EDWARD BLAKE, 63, but amazingly not far from his physical prime--body chiseled, built like a truck. Handsome too, save the LONG SCAR running down the side of his face.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Blake removes the kettle from the stove. He scoops some Asian tea leaves from a can, dumps them in a cup.</NARRATIVE>
