<NARRATIVE>The rest of him is encased in a knee-length raincoat. He wears gloves and is carrying a large, brown-paper-covered package by a wooden handle attached to the twine securing it.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>The box has been addressed in black felt marker -- "Everest Printing Corp., 826 Lafayette St." -- and appears quite heavy.</NARRATIVE>
