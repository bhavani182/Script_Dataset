<NARRATIVE>A FULL SHOT -- with a line of men now standing on the edge of the platform looking toward camera. Train steams slowly in past camera, and stops, with a tall, wide-shouldered man of about 28 (Rocklin), dressed in new store clothes, cowboots and a broad-brimmed white hat, in f.g. standing on steps of day coach with a small valise and saddle in his hands. Behind Rocklin a conductor.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>As Rocklin comes along the platform carrying the valise in one hand and balancing the saddle on his shoulder with the other, a man behind him picks up the two mail sacks and exits from scene. The station bums look at Rocklin curiously. His expression giving no encouragement, they slink back out of the sun and begin to settle down in their old places again. At the ticket office, Rocklin pauses and looks around uncertainly.</NARRATIVE>
