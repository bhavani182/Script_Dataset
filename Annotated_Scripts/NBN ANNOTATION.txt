<NARRATIVE>WAYNE GAYLE, a young, energetic, commando journalist a'la Geraldo Rivera, is sitting on the visitor side of the county jail visiting area. Wayne is alone, and the visiting area is empty. Apparently, some arrangement was made for the visit. Wayne has a miniature tape recorder in his hand and is testing it.</NARRATIVE>

</DIALOGUE>

<NARRATIVE>Wayne shuts off the recorder, rewinds, and plays it back. It works beautifully. He hits the record button and conceals the recorder in his sport coat jacket.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>The door opens on the prisoner side, and <Character_Name>Mickey Knox</Character_Name> is led into the room by two SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. Mickey's wearing the county jail blue jumpsuit. He has a thick and wide leather belt around his waist with a metal ring built into each side. Long, sturdy chains with handcuffs on each end are wrapped across his body and through the rings, binding his arms to his sides. His hands and feet are double cuffed.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>The Deputies both have their guns drawn, ready to blow Mickey in half at the slightest provocation. For a man wrapped and bound in chains, Mickey seems strangely in control of his environment. Even restrained as he is by the symbols of society (the chains, jail, guards, guns, jumpsuit), he remains a dangerous, intimidating, and fascinating figure.</NARRATIVE>

</Turn>

<Turn>
<Character_Name>WAYNE</Character_Name>
<Utterence>You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out there with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that.</Utterence>
</Turn>

<Turn>

<NARRATIVE>DR. REINGHOLD Well, for one, the media has done a tremendous job of turning the husband and wife mass murderers into celebrities. But it's the country's youth who have turned the couple into the ultimate anti-heroes. Basically, the very thing that makes them most lethal is the exact same thing that captures the public's hearts and minds -- Mickey and Mallory's operatic devotion to each other. In a world where people can't seem to make the simplest relationships work and the slightest emotional commitment is considered devastating, Mick and Mallory have a do-or-die romance of a Shakespearean magnitude. To the country's youth, 75 percent of which are coming from broken homes, that's appealing. They have an 'us against the world' posture which always appeals to youth. And they've taken that posture seventeen steps beyond. It's not 'us against the world,' it's 'we're gonna kill the world.' They're exciting. I read their file and I find myself turning the page like it was a paperback. Why do disillusioned youths get into Mickey and Mallory? Why do disillusioned housewives read romance novels? Why are you filming this special? Because you know as well as I do, you say 'tonight at nine Charles Manson speaks,' everybody's going to tune in to hear what he says. Mickey and Mallory have shocked a country numb with violence. They've created a world where only two exist and anybody who inadvertently enters that world is murdered.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>worth his robe will tell you the same thing. It couldn't help but affect my decision. That's why they have judges. We're supposed to be fair to a fault, but when it's showtime, we have to make a decision. That's why we don't just input all the facts into a computer for the appropriate punishment. I couldn't give them the death penalty. See, California hops back and forth on that issue. Mickey and Mallory went to court when it was out of favor, which is actually good because it leaves more room for imagination. Anybody can give somebody the chair. When you have someone who deserves to die and you can't kill them, you have to be creative. And if the bastards had let it stand, it would of been the perfect sentence. It hit 'em right where they lived. Far more punishing than the death sentence.</NARRATIVE>

    <Utterence>Well, in a rogue's gallery of killers,</Utterence>
  </Turn>
</DIALOGUE>
<NARRATIVE>I've seen a lot of killers in my day and they're a very cold lot. They have no more feelings about taking a person's life than squashing a tiny bug. It's all the same to them. Well, Mickey and Mallory were that 'kill 'em to watch their expression change' attitude personified. Except with each other. And, since they lived only for each other, I wanted to attack that, at its very root. So, in a nutshell, my sentence was double life for each without any possibility for parole. That would be fairly standard in their case. The twist I added was that the husband and wife would have no contact or correspondence with each other for the rest of their lives. And they would never receive any word or information about the other. So, basically once the cell door slams shut, Mickey and Mallory will completely disappear from each other's life. They'll never know when the other dies. But alas, the best laid plans of mice and men...</NARRATIVE>

The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.</NARRATIVE>

<Scene Heading>INT. DR. REINGHOLD'S OFFICE - DAY</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE>Back with Dr. Reinghold. He's laughing.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>DR. REINGHOLD It's a funny situation actually. If anyone besides Mickey and Mallory give a damn, what the prison board is doing would be considered an outrage. The prison board is basically saying, 'We can't handle these guys.' They've moved 'em around twice since their sentence started. They were a handful everywhere they went. Now the prisons they're at now want them outta there. But no other prison's gonna be stupid enough to take 'em. So the prison board is left scratching their heads wondering what they're gonna do. Well, what they decided to do was to set up a kangaroo medical court that found them crazy. Then they get them transferred to Nystrom Medical Asylum or Lobotomy Bay as it's referred to in the psychiatric circle. Put 'em on a strict dope and electro shock diet, and Mickey and Mallory cease to be a problem to anybody except the orderlies who clean out the bedpans, which if you want to see them get theirs, that's all well and good. But there's something being said here. Forget the immorality for a second. Forget the corruption and the skulduggery involved. What the board is saying is 'we give up.' Mickey and Mallory ran amuck in polite society. They were put in an alternative society and they ran amuck there, too. All the powers that be, can't deal with these two kids. And whatever can't be assimilated has to be terminated.</NARRATIVE>

    <Utterence>So, in your opinion Mickey and Mallory</Utterence>

</DIALOGUE>

<NARRATIVE>DR. REINGHOLD Insane, no. Psychotic, yes. A menace to living creatures, yes. But to suggest that they're insane gives the impression that they don't know right from wrong. Mickey and Mallory know the difference between right and wrong. They just don't give a damn.</NARRATIVE>

Anyway, Warren showed me all these different models of guns. Magnums, automatics, pistols, Walters. And I ask to see a shotgun. He brings me a Mossberg pump action shotgun. As soon as I held that baby in my hands, I knew what I was gonna do. It felt so good. It felt like it was a part of me. They had a mirror in the store. I looked at myself holding it, and looked so fuckin' good, I immediately bought it. Bought a bunch of boxes of ammo.
