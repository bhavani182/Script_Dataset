<NARRATIVE> A conversation between <Character_Name>COSTA</Character_Name> and a woman, <Character_Name>GRACE</Character_Name>, that takes place in what we assume is an apartment or a similar setting. It is implied they are intimate. They have a physical interaction with kissing, but it doesn't lead to any other form of intimacy, and instead ends with Grace exiting abruptly.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Costa seems to be aware he won't see Grace again for some time. The nature of their separation isn't specified, but there's an implication that they might have a future event or situation where they'll meet again.</NARRATIVE>

<Scene Heading>EXT. COSTA'S APARTMENT - DAY</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE>The scene shifts outside to the next morning. Laval pulls up in an unmarked car (#1) and waves at the uniformed officer in another patrol car, who then drives off. This is a transition moment that seems to be leading into further events or plot developments.</NARRATIVE>
