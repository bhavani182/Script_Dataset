<Utterance>Now, as you know, the difficulty in explaining the fourth dimension is that it cannot be seen or felt - it must be thought of.</Utterance>

<Utterance>If you don't mind, George, would you refresh me on the first three dimensions?</Utterance>

<Character_Name>DR. HILLYER</Character_Name>
<Utterance>When I move in a straight line, forward or backward, that's one dimension. - When I move to the left or right, two dimensions. - When I move up and down, three dimensions.</Utterance>

<Utterance>No.</Utterance>

</Turn>

<Turn>
<Character_Name>TIME TRAVELLER</Character_Name>
<Utterance>I'm coming to that. But first, consider! Why is it that we usually ignore the fourth dimension? Because we have no freedom to move in it. We can move in the other three -- up, down, forward, backward, sideways.</Utterance>

<NARRATIVE>The laboratory has the appearance of having once been a greenhouse.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Only a few potted plants remain. The glass walls are obscured from view from the garden by rows of tall growing plants.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Only the glass skylight is clear. Thick, dark, low-hanging clouds are passing beneath the moon, dimming its light and leaving the interior a maze of dark shadows.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>As the slow moving clouds pass overhead, a shaft of moonlight seeps through and we SEE workbenches, numerous tools, sheets of drawings and scientific instruments situated around the perimeter.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>The most conspicuous object in the room is the Time Machine. It is a duplicate of the miniature model</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Staring at the Machine, hypnotized by his own crafts- manship, he locks the door with accustomed movement, then crosses to a workbench and lights a candle.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>The Time Traveller sets it in motion, polishing the crystal lever until its rough edges disappear and it sparkles like a fine cut diamond. As he works, his lips purse and he softly STARTS TO WHISTLE the melancholy strains of "The Land Of The Leal."</NARRATIVE>
