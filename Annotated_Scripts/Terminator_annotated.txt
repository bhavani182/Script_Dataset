<NARRATIVE>A1, EXT. SCHOOLYARD - NIGHT. Silence gradually gives way to distant traffic sounds.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>A LOW ANGLE bounded by a chain-link fence and the one-story public school buildings shows spray-can hieroglyphics and streetlight shadows.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>This is a Los Angeles public school in a blue-collar neighborhood.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>ANGLE BETWEEN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, where a trash dumpster looms. A CAT enters FRAME, CAMERA DOLLIES FORWARD with him through the landscape of trash receptacles and shadows.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE> The sound of stray electrical CRACKLING subsides, and the frame comes to rest on the figure of a NAKED MAN kneeling, faced away, in the previously empty yard.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE> The man stands slowly, revealing himself to be in his late thirties, tall and powerfully built, moving with graceful precision.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE> C.U. - MAN, his facial features reiterate the power of his body and are dominated by the eyes, which are intense, blue and depthless.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE> His hair is military short, indicating a background in the military or law enforcement.</NARRATIVE>
