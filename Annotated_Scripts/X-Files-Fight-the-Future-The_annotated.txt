<NARRATIVE>A blinding white screen, under which we hear an ominous low end Dolby THX Big Screen rumble.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>We're not in 19" television land anymore, Toto.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>As the rumble builds, TWO BLACK FIGURES appear on what now has resolved into a distant horizon.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>From their movements we can shortly see that the figures are men.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Moving along a windswept ice sheet in an otherwise featureless land.</NARRATIVE>


<NARRATIVE>The two black figures come into clearer view as they move closer to us.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>They are dressed in long, dark coats and seem to be walking purposefully across the snow-covered landscape.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>As they draw nearer, we can see that one of them is carrying a small bag slung over his shoulder.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>The two men stop at the edge of a cliff overlooking a vast expanse of snow-covered terrain.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>They confer in hushed tones, then turn and begin to make their way down into the valley below.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>The camera follows them as they descend into the valley, the sound of their footsteps echoing off the walls of the snow-covered cliffs.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>As they reach the bottom of the valley, we see that they are standing in front of a large, ominous-looking door.</NARRATIVE>

<DIALOGUE>

<NARRATIVE>The door is old and worn, with intricate carvings etched into its surface.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>One of the men reaches out to grasp the door handle, but hesitates as if unsure what lies beyond.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>He looks up at his companion, who nods curtly before reaching out and pulling open the creaking door.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>The camera follows them as they step through the doorway and into the unknown.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>The door slams shut behind them, plunging us into darkness.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>The torch, which lies on the ground, illuminates the dead creature's face. Its wounds are flowing with the oily black blood, which, oddly now, BEGINS TO POOL. As if it has intelligence, sentience. Pooling and traveling into a fissure in the cave floor. And disappearing.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>ANGLE ON THE SECOND PRIMITIVE</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Watching this, unknowing. His chest heaving from the fight, as the spots of oily black blood which have spattered onto him begin to crawl. Crawling toward his eyes and mouth. Causing him to let out grunts of fear.</NARRATIVE>
