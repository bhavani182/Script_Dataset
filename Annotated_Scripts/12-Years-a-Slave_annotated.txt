<Scene Heading>1 INT. TOWNHOUSE/STUDY - DAY</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE>A finely appointed study, <Location>New York City</Location>, early April 1841.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>We see a pair of black hands as they open a package of violin strings.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Close on the hands stringing a violin. It's not high end but quite nice.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>We cut to a wide shot of the study, sitting in a chair with a violin is <Character_Name>SOLMON NORTHUP</Character_Name>, a man in his late twenties.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Everything about Solomon, his mien and manner, is distinguished. But he too seems a hardy individual. Someone who has known manual labor in his time.</NARRATIVE>

<Scene Heading>FAIRLY YOUNG, in their early twenties</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE>The men and women are dressed in very fine attire. We should get the sense that for the most part they are people of means.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>The furniture has been set aside in the living room. At the moment the couples are engaged in the dancing of a REEL.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>The music they are dancing to is being played by Solomon, having cut directly from the tune he was previously playing. He plays with a light determination, and in no way seems possessed with empty servitude.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Solomon concludes the reel, and the dancers break into enthusiastic applause, which is followed by personal thanks and congratulations from all. It should be clear that despite their respective races there is much admiration and appreciation for Solomon's abilities.</NARRATIVE>

<Scene Heading>INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/BEDROOM - MORNING</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE>It is a Saturday morning. Clad in her finest attire is ANNE; Solomon's wife, a few years younger than he. We see also the Northup children: MARGARET who is eight, and ALONZO who is five. They are handsome, and well groomed kids.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Anne straightens up the children. She finishes, she rises up and stands behind them, almost as if preparing to pose for a portrait.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>They all wait a moment, then Solomon enters the foyer.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Solomon stands and looks admiringly at his family. ADMIRINGLY stressed. It isn't that he doesn't have love for them, he does as well. But in the moment, he truly admires his greatest accomplishment: a family that is healthy and well and provided for.</NARRATIVE>

<Scene Heading>EXT. STREET - DAY</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE>Solomon and his family are out walking along the streets and groves of <Location>Saratoga</Location>. The streets are well populated this morning with many people out strolling. Most are <Character_Name>WHITE</Character_Name>, but there are also <Character_Name>BLACKS</Character_Name> as well, who are FREED BLACKS mingling fairly easily - though not always completely - with the whites.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>We see, too, a few <Character_Name>BALCK SLAVES</Character_Name> who travel with their WHITE MASTERS. These pairings are largely from the south and - despite the fact the blacks are slaves - they are not physically downtrodden, not field hands. They are well dressed and "leading apparently an easy life" - comparatively speaking - as they trail their masters.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>As they walk, Solomon and his family arrive at an intersection well-worn and muddied from horse and cart traffic.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE> It is day now. The door to the yard is thrown open. The harsh white light floods all over <Character_Name>Solomon</Character_Name>.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE> The camera is positioned at a specific angle, indicated by the notation "A32". This suggests a possible camera move or adjustment.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE> It is a yard just beyond Burch's. The yard is hemmed in by a brick wall. In the yard are two men, and a boy. The oldest is <Character_Name>CLEMENS RAY</Character_Name>, a man of about 25 years of age. He is well educated. <Character_Name>JOHN WILLIAMS</Character_Name> is about 20 years old. He is born and bred a slave, is lacking in education, and overwhelmed with fear of the situation.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE> Solomon walks along a well-worn path, shopping bag draped over one shoulder. We see his feet. As the walk slowly gathers pace, Solomon suddenly turns left into dense foliage. His tread is now a full blown sprint, trees flash past as Solomon attacks his way through the woods. The sound of branches cracking underneath. His feet, heartbeat and breath almost deafening. He is desperate. The violence of his advance abruptly stops, there is silence. We see in a clearance a posse of patrollers, preparing for a lynching of two young men. </NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE> Solomon's eyes meet those of the patrollers. The two men look back at Solomon with a look of fear as one of the patrollers checks the noose around their neck.
