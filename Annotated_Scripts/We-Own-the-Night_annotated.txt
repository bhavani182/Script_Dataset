<NARRATIVE>ANGLE ON: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY, thirties. Bobby's OLDER
          BROTHER. In uniform. Clean-cut, though not neurotically
          so. Sharp, tough features--the GLOW of a WINNER. He is
          SMILING, receiving many AD-LIBBED CONGRATULATIONS and

          holding one of his children in his arms, infant PAUL. Next

          to him is his wife, SANDRA, thirties. Next to her, their

          older infant, TEDDY.

<NARRATIVE>NEXT TO JOSEPH: BURT GRUSINSKY, sixty. Bobby's father, we
          will soon learn. Tough as nails. Unsentimental, ex-
          military, rough-edged, vital. In this world, he is a king.

<NARRATIVE>Standing behind Burt are his two closest associates:
          MICHAEL SOLO ("G.Q."), fifties, somewhat urbane, and JACK

          SHAPIRO ("Pudge"), also fifties. A big, quiet man. Huge

          hands. The enforcer. Burt is beaming over his treasured

          son. He directs a PHOTOGRAPHER, repositions Joseph:
