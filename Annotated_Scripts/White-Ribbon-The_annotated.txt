<Scene Heading>COVERED RIDING SCHOOL OF THE MANORIAL ESTATE INT/DAY</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE>MONTAGE OF CLOSE-SHOTS: A man is riding a dressage horse. We can't see his face. Only his boots, spurs, whip, the taut reins, the horse's foamy mouth, the movements that steer the animal.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>We watch him for a while and hear the SNORTS of the horse, the dull SOUND of THE HOOVES on the ground, the fast-uttered COMMANDS of the rider. Then we start to hear a gentle voice:</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE> The woman, who because of an injured arm could only do light work, had been dispensed by the steward from harvesting chores, and was assigned to easier work in the sawmill. </NARRATIVE>

Here is the annotated script:

<Scene Heading>IN A CHURCH - DAY</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE>The narrator talks about <Character_Name>A CHILD</Character_Name>, who was not returned from the hospital. This accident was caused by a wire that had been strung in his garden with the explicit intent of bringing him down. And in that case too, nobody knows anything, saw anything or heard anything.</NARRATIVE>

<Utterence>We all know that the people responsible for the terrible injuries suffered by my son, and those suffered by the doctor are sitting here among us, in this room. I won't tolerate that crimes of this nature go unpunished. I don't wish something similar to happen to any of your children. That's why I call upon you all to help me find the culprit or the culprits. Ask questions, keep your ears open, be watchful. If we fail to find out the truth, the peace within our community will be gone.</Utterence>

<NARRATIVE>The pastor says a few last words which we don't grasp, that the narrator's voice drowns out. The people file out of the church, quietly and slowly, but talking worriedly to each other.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>NARRATOR: The landowner's speech frightened the people. Most knew about the incident at the Thanksgiving feast. But the majority didn't know exactly what had happened, and in the end they didn't care. The Baron was not really popular among the people, but he was respected as a powerful social figure, as well as the employer of nearly the whole village.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE> The schoolteacher, the steward and his wife come out from behind the house, leave the property and go their separate ways on the street. All that is left is the empty house with its closed shutters.</NARRATIVE>

Here is the annotated script:


<Scene Heading>MONTAGE: EXT/DAY</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE> The houses of the doctor, the pastor, the farmer, the street before the school, the estate's administrative buildings and the manor house. There is nobody to be seen. </NARRATIVE>

<NARRATOR>
<Utterance> During the next few weeks, the village gossip-factory worked overtime. </Utterance>
</NARRATOR>

<NARRATIVE> Some claimed, the doctor was Hansi's father. He and the midwife had tried to abort the child so that the shame of their relationship wouldn't be found out, and that's how the child became disabled. Others even went as far as to claim that there was something fishy about the death of the doctor's wife, and that they wouldn't be surprised, if the two weren't responsible for it. </NARRATIVE>

<NARRATOR>
<Utterance> Whoever had lynched the boy obviously knew about the hidden crimes of his parents. </Utterance>
</NARRATOR>

<NARRATIVE> Suddenly it seemed even possible that the doctor and the midwife, as potential murderers, were also the perpetrators of all the other crimes. It was suspected, that the doctor had wanted to spare his legitimate children and himself public disclosure of his guilt, and had therefore fled with them. Apparently he had taken the disabled boy with him out of guilt. Understandably enough, he had left behind his accomplice and the mother of the disgraced child. </NARRATIVE>

<NARRATOR>
<Utterance> The fact that it was on a bicycle that she tried to catch up with the man who had happily escaped, was the cause of a great deal of laughter. </Utterance>
</NARRATOR>

<NARRATIVE> The deserted estate is decorated with flags. On July 28th Austria declared war on Serbia. It was followed on Saturday, August 1rst, by the German declaration of war on Russia, and on France the following Monday. </NARRATIVE>

<Scene Heading>CHURCH INT/DAY</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE> HIGH ANGLE SHOT: The villagers are about to take their seats. The smaller children are sitting with their parents on the pews. All are in their Sunday best, the members of the militia are in uniform. Flags are planted. Joyful excitement reigns everywhere.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Once the church is full, the Baron, the Baroness and their son Sigi walk down the aisle and sit down in the front row.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>NARRATOR: On the Sunday between those dates, the whole village came to the festive service. An atmosphere of expectation and departure was in the air. From now on nothing would be the same.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Only a few days ago everybody would have called the life they lived as God's will, worthy of being lived, and would have shunned any change. The strange joy with which the coming war was greeted, showed that this certainty of order and security was based on very shaky foundations.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>CLOSE-UPS: Of all the adult leading characters of the film, aside from the doctor and the midwife. Also of Eva and her father.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>In the frenzy of patriotic enthusiasm that was flaring up, the events that had shaken Eichwald, had become an irrelevant. In the face of the coming war, Eva's father had taken his daughter back and, at her pleading, had come to Eichwald to cast an eye at the place where his future son-in-law was living and working.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>The prospect that I might soon call this beloved creature my wife, turned this day also into a solemn day for me. The pastor never mentioned our conversation again. Our relationship was limited to what was required professionally. He apparently never went through with his threat to denounce me to the school-authorities.</NARRATIVE>
