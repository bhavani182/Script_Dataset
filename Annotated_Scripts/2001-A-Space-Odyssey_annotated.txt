<Scene Heading>A1</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE>The remorseless drought had lasted now for ten million years,
and would not end for another million.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>The reign of the terrible lizards had long since passed, but here on the continent
which would one day be known as Africa, the battle for survival
had reached a new climax of ferocity, and the victor was not
yet in sight.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>In this dry and barren land, only the small or
the swift or the fierce could flourish, or even hope to exist.</NARRATIVE>

<Scene Heading>A2</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE>The man-apes of the field had none of these attributes, and
they were on the long, pathetic road to racial extinction.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>About twenty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking
a small, parched valley, divided by a sluggish, brown stream.</NARRATIVE>

something akin to sadness.</Utterence>
</Turn>
</DIALOGUE>

<NARRATIVE>Then he carries his dead father out of the cave, and leaves him for the hyenas.</NARRATIVE>

<Scene Heading>A2</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE>The tribe had always been hungry, and now it was starving.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>About twenty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking
a small, parched valley, divided by a sluggish, brown stream.</NARRATIVE>

<Scene Heading>A2</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE> Among his kind, Moonwatcher is almost a giant. He is nearly five feet high, and though badly undernourished, weighs over a hundred pounds. His hairy, muscular body is quite man-like, and his head is already nearer man than ape. The forehead is low, and there are great ridges over the eye-sockets, yet he unmistakably holds in his genes the promise of humanity. As he looks out now upon the hostile world, there is already something in his gaze beyond the grasp of any ape. In those dark, deep-set eyes is a dawning awareness-the first intimations of an intelligence which would not fulfill itself for another two million years.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE> The confrontation lasts a few minutes - then the display dies out as quickly as it has begun, and everyone drinks his fill of the muddy water. Honor has been satisfied - each group has staked its claim to its own territory.</NARRATIVE>
</DIALOGUE>

<Scene Heading>A4</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE> EXT AFRICAN PLAIN - HERBIVORES Moonwatcher and his companions search for berries, fruit and leaves, and fight off pangs of hunger, while all around them, competing with them for the same fodder, is a potential source of more food than they could ever hope to eat. Yet</NARRATIVE>

Here is the annotated script:

<Scene Heading>A5</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE>The thousands of tons of meat roaming over the parched savanna and through the brush is not only beyond their reach; the idea of eating it is beyond their imagination.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>They are slowly starving to death in the midst of plenty.</NARRATIVE>

<Scene Heading>A6</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE>The tribe slowly wanders across the bare, flat countryside foraging for roots and occasional berries.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Eight of them are irregularly strung out on the open plain, about fifty feet apart.</NARRATIVE>

</DIALOGUE>

<Scene Heading>A7</Scene Heading>

<DIALOGUE>
<Turn>

<Utterence>But on the way back to the caves he finds a hive of bees in the stump of a dead tree, and so enjoys the finest delicacy his people could ever know.</Utterence>

<DIALOGUE>
<Turn>
<Character_Name>MOONWATCHER</Character_Name>
<Utterance>He is now as near to contentment as he is ever likely to be; for thought he is still hungry, he is not actually weak with hunger.</Utterance>
</Turn>
</DIALOGUE>

<NARRATIVE>That was the most that any hominid could hope for.</NARRATIVE>

<Scene Heading>A7 (continued)</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE>Over the valley, a full moon rises, and a cold wind blows down from the distant mountains.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>It would be very cold tonight - but cold, like hunger, was not a matter for any real concern; it was merely part of the background of life.</NARRATIVE>

<Scene Heading>EXT. CAVE - DAY</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE> This Little Sun, that only shone at night and gave no warmth, was dangerous; there would be enemies abroad.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE> Moonwatcher crawls out of the cave, clambers on to a large boulder besides the entrance, and squats there where he can survey the valley. If any hunting beast approached, he would have time to get back to the relative safety of the cave.</NARRATIVE>

<DIALOGUE>
<Turn>
<Character_Name>Moonwatcher</Character_Name>
<Utterance>Of all the creatures who had ever lived on Earth, Moonwatcher's race was the first to raise their eyes with interest to the Moon, and though he could not remember it, when he was young, Moonwatcher would reach out and try to touch its ghostly face.</Utterance>
</Turn>

<Turn>
<Character_Name>Moonwatcher</Character_Name>
<Utterance>Now he knew he would have to find a tree that was high enough.</Utterance>
</Turn>
</DIALOGUE>

<NARRATIVE>He stirs when shrieks and screams echo up the slope from one of the lower caves, and he does not need to hear the occasional growl of the lion to know what is happening. Down there in the darkness, old One-Eye and his family are dying, and the thought that he might help in some way never crosses Moonwatcher's mind. The harsh logic of survival rules out such fancies.</NARRATIVE>

<DIALOGUE>
<Turn>
<Character_Name>Moonwatcher</Character_Name>
<Utterance>Every cave is silent, lest it attract disaster.</Utterance>
</Turn>
</DIALOGUE>

<NARRATIVE>And in the caves, in tortured spells of fitful dozing and fearful waiting, were gathered the nightmares of generations yet to come.</NARRATIVE>

<Scene Heading>EXT. THE STREAM - INVASION</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE>The Others are growing desperate; the forage on their side of the valley is almost exhausted. Perhaps they realise that Moonwatcher's tribe has lost three of its numbers during the night, for they choose this mourning to break the truce.</NARRATIVE>

<DIALOGUE>
<Turn>
<Character_Name>Moonwatcher</Character_Name>
<Utterance>When they meet at the river in the still, misty dawn, there is a deeper and more menacing note in their challenge. The noisy but usually harmless confrontation lasts only a few seconds before the invasion begins.</Utterance>
</Turn>

<Turn>
<Character_Name>Moonwatcher</Character_Name>
<Utterance>In an uncertainly-moving horde, the Others cross the river, shrieking threats and hunched for the attack. They are led by a big-toothed hominid of Moonwatcher's own size and age.</Utterance>
</Turn>
</DIALOGUE>

<Scene Heading>EXT. PLAINS - DAY</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE> Startled and frightened, the tribe retreats before the first <Location>advance</Location>, throwing nothing more substantial than imprecations at the invaders.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE> Moonwatcher moves with them, his mind a mist of rage and confusion. To be driven from their own territory is a great badness, but to lose the river is death. He does not know what to do; it is a situation beyond his experience.</NARRATIVE>

<DIALOGUE>

<Utterance>(to himself) Maybe we can turn this around.</Utterance>

<Utterance>(to himself) This could be the opportunity I need.</Utterance>
</Turn>
</DIALOGUE>

<NARRATIVE> By chance, he chooses this moment to grab the hair on Big-Tooth's scalp, and bang his head on the ground. The resulting CRACK is so satisfactory, and produces such an immediate weakening in Big-Tooth's resistance, that he quickly repeats it.</NARRATIVE>

<Scene Heading>April 12th, 2001</Scene Heading>

<NARRATIVE>The first evidence for intelligent life outside the Earth was discovered.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>It was found buried at a depth of fifteen metres in the crater Tycho.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>No news of this was ever announced, and the event had been kept secret since then, for reasons which I will later explain.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Soon after it was uncovered, it emitted a powerful blast of radiation in the radio spectrum which seems to have triggered by the Lunar sunrise.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Luckily for those at the site, it proved harmless.</NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE>Perhaps you can imagine our astonishment when we later found it was aimed precisely at Saturn.</NARRATIVE>

<DIALOGUE>

<Character_Name>FLOYD</Character_Name>
<Utterance>A lot of thought went into the question of whether or not it was sun-triggered, as it seemed illogical to deliberately bury a sun-powered device.</Utterance>

<NARRATIVE>We finally concluded that the only reason you might bury a sun-powered device would be to keep it inactive until it would be uncovered, at which time it would absorb sunlight and trigger itself.</NARRATIVE>
