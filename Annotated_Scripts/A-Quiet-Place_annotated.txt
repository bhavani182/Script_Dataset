<NARRATIVE> Marcus sits at the edge of a DESCENDING DRIVEWAY connecting to the road that heads back toward the BARN. He lands in the sand without a sound and begins to walk, head held low, toward the dark figure... who reaches his hand out and briefly touches Marcus' shoulder. Marcus walks straight past. </NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE> As MARCUS exits we BOOM UP the dark figure as it turns, revealing LEON ABBOTT (LEE), 38. LEE too has changed, though much more obviously. He has lost weight on his strong farmer frame, he wears a beard and his sunken eyes indicate that he hasn't slept well... in a long time. </NARRATIVE>

<NARRATIVE> WE PULL BACK WIDE to reveal the sea of farm equipment sits in front of a long, dilapidated, work shed roof... a makeshift repair shop. The word `REPAIR' is written in flaking white paint that clings to the wood above. </NARRATIVE>
